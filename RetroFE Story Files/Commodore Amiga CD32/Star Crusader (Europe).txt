 Star Crusader is a 3D space combat simulator in which the player takes the role of Roman Alexandria who is in the middle of a galaxy-wide war between the authoritarian Gorenes and rebels. During the course of the game, the player can decide which of the opposing forces to join. Both sides in the game feature very different crafts. The Gorenes has rather conventional crafts for solidly armed and armored crafts. The rebel side features some unusual weapons like disabler beam, cloaking device, and other special abilities.
