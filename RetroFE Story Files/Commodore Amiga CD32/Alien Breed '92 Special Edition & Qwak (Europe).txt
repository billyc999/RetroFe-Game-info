 A compilation which includes the following games on one CD: Alien Breed '92 Special Edition: An interrim between Alien Breed and its sequel. Gameplay is the same as its predecessor - each level is a maze to be navigated through, while fighting off hordes of aliens. The Special Edition 92 includes 12 new levels and a bunch of new features: "dark missions" in which only the glowing blue eyes of the aliens are visible, and the ability to jump to a level by means of a code. Quak:In this game, you play a duck and the object of the game is to get the highest score without losing all your lives. This can be achieved by getting all the fruit and gems in the level, or killing off enemies. There are 80 levels to complete and once you complete all of them, the levels are repeated. You exit each level by collecting all the gold keys then entering through the door that opens. You have a certain amount of time to complete the level before spikes fall down the level. There are eight areas, all consisting of ten levels. At the end of each area, there is a guardian waiting for you, and again, you have a certain amount of time to defeat them.You kill enemies by throwing orange-colored eggs at them, and in the earlier levels, they go down in one or two shots, but in later levels, you'll find out that all of them take more than two shots to bring down, so your orange balls would be useless here. The solution is to get a special power-up that will give you chocolate eggs.
