 This compilation contains the updated edition of shoot 'em up Project-X: Six levels of horizontally-scrolling shooting await in this R-Type style action game. The attack waves vary in style, with some attacking you from quite fiendish angles.These give off blue power-up tokens, which are used towards selecting one of many weapons. There are 4 front-firing options (guns, plasma, magma and laser-beams - guns can be built up quickly but lack top-end power compared to the others) as well as speed-up (only requires one token), side-shot, up to 3 homing missiles, build (a quick super-destructive blast that only functions when you aren't using auto-fire) and stealth (a period of invulnerability). F17 Challenge:  A third-person racing game featuring real Formula 1 cars and circuits, which represented Team 17's first attempt at the genre. There are two gameplay modes, Arcade and Normal - in Arcade mode you have to finish in the top 3 each time, whereas in Normal mode you accumulate the appropriate points, irrespective of one or two bad results. There are 3 difficulty levels, and the number of laps is variable. The field includes 22 cars (you can choose between a Ferrari, Williams, McLaren and Benetton), and contact with these (or with the kerbing or roadside barriers) inflicts damage on your car. This may get bad enough that you have to pit for repairs (if you don't make it to the pits and have more contact, you may get forced out altogether). Avoiding the slower cars you come up to lap can be crucial.
