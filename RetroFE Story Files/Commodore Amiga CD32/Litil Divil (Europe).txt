 Very nice action/adventure game for kids, as much as for the adult-kids. You are, as a game's name says, a little devil, in a real sense of word. The playing is either from the back view as you go wandering the tunnels and castles, or like an ordinary 2D adventure where you have to fight, jump or squash something.
