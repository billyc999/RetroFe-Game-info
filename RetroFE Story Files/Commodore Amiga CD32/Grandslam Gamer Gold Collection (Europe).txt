 The Grandslam Gamer Gold Collection is a compilation of three games that received the CD32 Gamer Gold award. It consists of:Bump'N'burn: Mario Kart is taken one step further in this racer. The computer racers include Loretta L’Amour, the Buck-Toothed Beavers, and the uncompromising Colonel Carnage, each of which have individual looking cars, varied weapons, and some attempts at humour and pathos. •Nick Faldo's Championship Golf: Arc Developments created a 3D game world called Reality3 for this simulation, licensed around one of Britain's top players. There are two courses, plus a hidden 9-hole course on Mars with reduced gravity, with match play and stroke play options against one of 8 varied-difficulty computer players. •Jetstrike: In Jetstrike you must stop the devious SPUDD forces by attacking them with your "borrowed" aircraft. Your Commanding Officer will give you a mission objective which you have to try to achieve without being shot down, blown up or crashing into mountains.
