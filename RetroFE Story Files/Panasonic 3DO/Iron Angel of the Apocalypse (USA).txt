 The box for Iron Angel of the Apocalypse describes itself as an "Action Role-Playing Movie."  Apparently this is the phrase used to describe a simple first-person shooter with a lot of live-action cutscenes.You play a character known as Tetsujin.  You are a cyborg/robot creation of an evil scientist.  The scientist intended to use you to wipe out the human race, but instead you decided to turn against your maker and escape.  The story unfolds as you fight your way to the top of a skyscraper to confront the mad scientist.
