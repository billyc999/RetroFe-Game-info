The 20 creatures that can be captured are protected by drones, which can in turn be destroyed with the blaster weapon. Other actions the player can take is speeding up or slowing down the Hawk King, and extending a rod to capture a rare species once the player encounters one.After a creature has been successfully captured, the player enters the trophy room though a portal, which displays all captured creatures.
