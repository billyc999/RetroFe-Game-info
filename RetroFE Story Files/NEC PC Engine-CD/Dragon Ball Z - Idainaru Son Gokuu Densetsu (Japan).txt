 Dragon Ball Z: Idainaru Goku Densetsu illustrates Goku's seven greatest battles: Fighting Tao Pai Pai, challenging Tenshinhan at the Martial Arts Tournament, destroying Piccolo Daimao (who had killed Kuririn, Master Roshi and Chaozu), fighting Piccolo Jr. at the Martial Arts Tournament, protecting Earth from Vegita, saving Namek from Freeza and avenging the Saiyans, and nobly sacrificing his life to save the world from Perfect Cell. During the game, Gohan is telling Goten stories about Goku, his father, who died before he was born. As each story is told, it is your job to play out the battles as they occurred in the series. Cinematics help to tell the stories in graphic detail. Other characters from the series will occasionally come to help Gohan tell the stories.
