Yo! Noid is an adventure that takes you skipping, skating and skyscraper scaling through the streets of New York City. Your players will need every gimmick imaginable to out-prank the group of slippery scalawags who are disrupting the Big Apple with assorted monkeyshines and shenanigans. A mysterious Noid look-alike is the brains behind the bad guys. But if Yo! Noid can prevail, the reward is a lifetime supply of pizzas. Players of all ages will enjoy romping through the 14 levels of fun. And the good times don't stop there.
As was the case with many Capcom games based on cartoon characters, Yo! Noid had excellent cartoon graphics and sound effects.
