Players explore the universe in full combat readiness as they help Solar Jetman recover the sabotaged Golden Warship -- the most powerful spacecraft in the galaxy. On 12 alien worlds, each with its own army of enraged aliens and their deadly devices, the necessary parts to repair the damaged vessel are hidden. Players must act fast and with finesse to fend off the destructive alien forces, gravity, baffing booby traps, perpetual black holes, and cosmic space warps. It's intense galactic rivalry that'll keep players in orbit.
