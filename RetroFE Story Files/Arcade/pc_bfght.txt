In Balloon Fight, you control a person who flies around with two balloons on his back. You have to defeat men in bird costumes, who have one balloon on their backs. When the balloon is popped, the enemy will float down on a parachute, and go on the ground. Either harm it before it blows up another balloon while on the ground or on the parachute to knock it out. If you don't knock out the enemy, it will go to the next color and be stronger. If you lose one balloon, you're still in the game although you rise slower, but if you lose both, you'll lose a life. You can lose a life by falling in the water, getting hit by lightning, getting hit by an enemy, or getting eaten by a fish.
