They're back! And bigger than ever. In an exhilarating, action-packed sequel to their record-busting first game. And this time their arch-enemy, Shredder, isn't pulling any punches. Lethal electro-zappers, laser beams and freezer burners plus nasty scoundrels like Scorpion Robots and Stone Warriors are ready to make turtle soup out of our heroes. Worse yet, Tora and Shogun, two alien bounty hunters who have never known defeat, are also itching for a take-no-prisoners showdown.
