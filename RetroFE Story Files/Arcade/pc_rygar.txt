Armed with a deadly mace-like weapon tipped with a spinning razor disc, Rygar the warrior must fight through twenty-seven sideways scrolling levels, killing the vast swathes of enemy monsters that attack him.
Bonus items and weapon power-ups can be found, sometimes dropped by felled monsters but more commonly hidden in the stone carvings that litter the levels. Weapon power-ups include an increased range on the mace and a shield that render Rygar temporarily invincible to the enemies.
