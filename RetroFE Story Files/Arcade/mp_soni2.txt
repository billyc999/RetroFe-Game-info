The nefariously evil scientist Dr. Ivo Robotnik is at it again with his demented goal to conquer the world by forcing innocent animals to become evil 'badniks' (robots), and only one speedy hedgehog is eager enough to put a stop to Robotnik's scheme and his name is Sonic The Hedgehog. and this time he's not alone, Miles Prower (miles per hour, get it?). The Fox who's commonly known as 'Tails' because he has 2 tails which enable him to fly has decided to tag along with Sonic in order to bring peace back to the planet.
