Sailor Moon (or Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon) is a beat 'em up video game
developed by Angel in 1993, and ported to the Super Famicom. It was
localized in the Europe exclusively in French in 1994. The Mega Drive
version was developed and published by Ma-Ba, although certain elements were
recycled from the Super Famicom version.

The game is set in the first series of Sailor Moon, and the player takes
control of one or two of the five heroines. Each Sailor Soldier has some
sequences of blows, three aerial attacks (neutral, moving forward/backward,
downward) and a special charge-up projectile.

The enemies are mostly the youma of the Dark Kingdom that appeared in the
anime, but if more than one of the same kind appears at once, the others are
colored differently (a common device for this genre of games).
