In the previous winter, the Three Fairies of Light wanted to gather other fairies to cooperate with each other. They decided that the only way to do so was with force, so they destroyed Cirno's house. Cirno mistook this as a declaration of war. The following spring, after searching at various locations she finally meets all three of them at once, so she could punish them. Cirno was convinced she was the strongest, and would challenge anyone who looks strong. Aya Shameimaru said that there were some humans done with flower viewings, and that is where Cirno found Marisa Kirisame.
