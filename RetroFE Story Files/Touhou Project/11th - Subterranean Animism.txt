Suddenly a geyser erupted out of nowhere, which Reimu Hakurei and Marisa Kirisame took advantage of, even though a higher amount of earth spirits showed up. But others got worried, and wanted them to go down into the Underworld, with a device Yukari Yakumo made so they could talk even underground. After passing the tsuchigumo Yamame Kurodani and the jealous bridge princess Parsee Mizuhashi, the heroine reaches the Former Capital, a place where now the oni live. Yuugi Hoshiguma challenges the heroine on a friendly battle, and then says the heroine should go to the Palace of the Earth Spirits. Here, the heroine met Satori Komeiji, the owner of both Rin Kaenbyou (Orin) and Utsuho Reiuji (Okuu). Rin wanted the heroine to come down and help her stop her friend as Utsuho became too powerful, and Utsuho eventually was stopped by the heroine. Afterwards, the heroine visits the Moriya Shrine to talk with Kanako Yasaka and Suwako Moriya. The goddesses were not there, but she does meet Satori's sister, Koishi Komeiji, who wanted to go to the Moriya Shrine to ask the gods to empower her pets. In the end, they have a duel because Koishi wanted to see if the person who defeated her sister was really that strong.
