The story of Undefined Fantastic Object is about a strange flying object that appears in the skies of Gensokyo during the early springtime. The player character will, for whatever reason their shot type description says, launch off into the sky to unravel its mysteries, plunder its treasure, and generally get rid of youkai. Upon reaching the Stage 4 boss, Minamitsu Murasa, the story begins to unravel. The objective of most of the enemies in the game is to free a human named Byakuren Hijiri from a sealed sleep of hundreds of years. Interestingly enough, every character besides Kogasa Tatara has an important role in the plot. Each with their own reasons, the enemies attempt to collect these UFOs - actually fragments of the "floating vault", Tobikura - the player has been collecting, but the player eventually unseals and faces Byakuren herself out of curiosity. After the events of the main story, it is known that Byakuren and her followers erect a Buddhist temple in Gensokyo. However, in order to figure out what the UFO objects really were, the player later encounters Nue Houjuu, who reveals that she was the one aiding and obstructing both the player and enemy factions during the main story. The reason the fragments of Tobikura had been scattered was because she had placed Seeds of Unknown Form in them, and the reason they appeared to be UFOs was essentially because nothing else should be floating through the sky like that.
