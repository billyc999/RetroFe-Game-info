It is autumn in Gensokyo. A stranger comes to the Hakurei Shrine and says that the shrine should close for good. Reimu Hakurei won't let it happen so she or Marisa Kirisame goes to investigate the situation. The heroine goes to the Youkai Mountain where she meets three gods and eventually Nitori Kawashiro, who says the kappa are troubled by a new god on the mountain. As she advances further, the heroine meets Aya Shameimaru, who was told to investigate the intruder. Aya is beaten and the heroine moves to the Moriya Shrine. Sanae Kochiya says that the new god, later shown to be Kanako Yasaka, is trying to collect faith. After Sanae is defeated, Kanako appears and explains her motives. She eventually makes peace with the kappa and tengu, who, in return, accept Kanako as the new god of the mountain, supplying her with faith. In the Extra stage, the heroines meet the other god of the Moriya Shrine, Suwako Moriya, who is the shrine's true god. Suwako demands that they play with her in a danmaku battle, just like they've played with Sanae and Kanako.
