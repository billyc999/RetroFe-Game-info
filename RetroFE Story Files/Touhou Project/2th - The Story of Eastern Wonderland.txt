The story involves Reimu's investigation of monsters that appeared suddenly at the Hakurei Shrine. This time around, she takes two Yin-Yang Orbs, and her turtle servant Genjii in order to fly. She encounters Rika with her Flower-Tank and Meira who want to fight Reimu for personal reasons. She then travels through the World of Fantasies, which is between Gensokyo and Makai, and defeats the Five Magic Stones in order to reach Reimaden, which is where she meets Marisa Kirisame and re-encounters Mima. Marisa appears to be the ghost's servant. Mima disappears after suffering a defeat by Reimu's hand, but the monsters and spirits around the shrine don't seem to have gone away. During the extra stage, Rika attacks once more, this time with her new tank Evil Eye Î£. After defeating the engineer, Reimu returns to the shrine to find the monsters gone.
