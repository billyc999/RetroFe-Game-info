Kioh Gyoku is a vertical danmaku shooting game with massive emphasis on grazing streaming bullets, where two characters engage in danmaku gameplay within individual and separate play areas (aka. split-screen). Upon meeting certain conditions, players are able to unleash a variety of character-specific attacks upon their opponents in an attempt to whittle down their remaining health points. In Story Mode, the player will face five opponents, each more capable than the previous. Kioh Gyoku also features a Match Play Mode where the player may face off against AI opponents or compete against other players, as well as watch AI vs. AI matches.
