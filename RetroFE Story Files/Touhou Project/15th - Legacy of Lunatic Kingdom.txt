Once, there was a being named Junko, a divine spirit with a grudge against the lunarians, especially Chang'e. This grudge came from the fact that Chang'e's husband shot down nine out of ten suns, according to legend, one of them landing on her son and killing him. Since then, she purified her grudge to the point where she's nothing more than pure resentment. Junko calmed her rage by repeatedly attacking the Lunar Capital, but none of her attacks have been successful. Then she met with Hecatia Lapislazuli, a goddess of Hell who sympathized with her because she also had a grudge against Chang'e. Hecatia allowed Junko to use fairies such as Clownpiece in her plan to invade the Lunar Capital and leave Chang'e vulnerable. Junko purified the Hell fairies into pure life force so they can wreak havoc on the Lunar Capital while also being immune to the lunarians' purifying weaponry. Because of this, the goddess Sagume Kishin and the moon sages froze the Lunar Capital and asked Doremy Sweet to make a replica Lunar Capital in the Dream World. Since the Lunarians couldn't stay in the Dream World forever, Sagume developed the "Lunar Capital Transfer Plan", which involved purifiying Gensokyo so it could be inhabited by the lunarians. But youkai were also living in Gensokyo, so Sagume created an Occult Orb that could spread a particular urban legend called the "Apollo Project Coverup Theory", so the Lunar Capital could materialize in Gensokyo, prompting the events of Urban Legend in Limbo, which would later turn into the events of Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom.
