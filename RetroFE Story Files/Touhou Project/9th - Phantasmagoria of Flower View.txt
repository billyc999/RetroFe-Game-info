This game takes place in the mystical land of Gensokyo. Spring has arrived, but something is wrong. Flowers are blooming and the fairies are becoming active as usual, but the amount of flowers and fairies is unnatural; even non-spring flowers are blooming. Playing as one of 16 characters, you must battle your way through 9 stages to reach Muenzuka and uncover the truth behind the abnormal spring.
