Another of the notorious adult-oriented Atari games developed and distributed (under the guise, strangely enough, as "Swedish Erotica") by the unlicensed game maker Mystique/Playaround. This was the only title where the publisher had to bow to censorship -- it declined to release the game in the US because of the fevor over the racial and violent implications Custer's Revenge.

This two-pack contains two variations on the 'classic' Custer's Revenge (renamed both because of the unfamiliarity of Custer to the European audience and the controversy over the original). Westward Ho is a remake, while General Re-Treat reverses the male and female roles. This time, the General having his revenge exacted back upon him -- that's Revenge, the name of the indian maiden of Custer's Revenge -- as he's tied to a totem pole. She'll brave the cannonfire of the corps and avoid the prickly cactus to force the General into Re-Treat!
