This is a doubled-ended cartridge with Philly Flasher on one end and Cathouse Blues on the other.

Philly Flasher is a graphically altered version of Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em with guys (or a guy) doing the catching and what they are catching looks to be milk from a witch's tit. The game plays just like Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em otherwise except the guy(s) masturbate after each round. 

Cathouse Blues is a graphically altered version of Gigolo in which you are a guy going to various whorehouses to get "serviced". The game is otherwise the same as Gigolo.
