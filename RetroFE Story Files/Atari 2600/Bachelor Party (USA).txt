This was a double-ended cartridge that contained Bachelor Party on one end and a new game, Gigolo, on the other.

In Gigolo, men will leave the jail and head to various houses. You must collect some money from the bank then make your way to the houses for sex you pay these men for. Once you have your money, avoid the thief who will kill you and steal all your cash (and game over).

After you are finished with a man, you must avoid or outrun the police. If you are arrested three times, the game is over. To run, move while holding down the button. Don't run every where or the police will chase you, thinking you're up to something.

You get 1 point for each thrust you do to a guy.
