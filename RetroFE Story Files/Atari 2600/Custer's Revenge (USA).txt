History was never quite like this.  In a "creative interpretation" of the Battle of Little Big Horn, a rowdy and naked General Custer must make his way through a hail of continual arrows to a Native American Princess tied to a pole.  If Custer can survive the obstacles in his way, he then gets an opportunity to have "sexual intercourse" for big points.  Whether his needs have been sated, or brought down by enemy fire, Custer will return again and again to get what he wants.  One of the few "adult oriented" titles for the Atari 2600.
