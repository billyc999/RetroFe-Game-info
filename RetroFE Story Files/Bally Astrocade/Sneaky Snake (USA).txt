 In Sneaky Snake: Each player starts with five "shooters," utilized one at a time.  The T.V. screen will present the player(s) with a field of multi-colored mushrooms.  At the top of the screen will appear the Snake, who will begin his decent downward, meandering over, under and around the mushrooms as he moves closer to you!  At the bottom of the playfield is your shooter, which you can maneuver left or right, and slightly up or down.  Using the trigger, you must shoot the Snake before he makes contact with your shooter.
