 Solar Conqueror is a top-down viewed shoot 'em up with multidirectional shooting and movement similar to Asteroids or Robotron. The war hungry DEMENS are threatening to wipe out the player's race with a radiation death ray and therefore the player has to conquer their solar systems.Each solar system consists of two or four planets and to conquer them all planets have to be defeated. In each screen a planet is located to the far right of the screen and from it various alien defenders will appear. To defeat the planet and move on to the next one the player has to kill all the enemies while avoiding getting hit by them. There are three different enemies: kamikaze combat ships, ground-to-air missiles and super fighting (killer) satellites. There are also asteroids floating around the planets that has to be avoided. Larger planets have stronger gravity which leads to the spaceship being harder control. The effect of the gravity increases as the ship gets closer to the planet.
