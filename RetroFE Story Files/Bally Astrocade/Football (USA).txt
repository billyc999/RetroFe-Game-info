 Football is an early attempt at simulating the American sport. The game is played from a top-down perspective and features two unnamed teams, one blue and one yellow. When starting out the offense first gets to choose which of five plays to be used. After that the playing field will be displayed and after the ball has been snapped the player controls the quarterback with the joystick. By pressing the trigger a throw is made and the flight of the ball depends on the angle of the quarterback's arm which is controlled with the knob on the controller. After the pass has been made offense gains control of the ends by using the joystick. The defense uses the joystick to control the patterns of the cornerbacks. The ball carrier is considered tackled when making contact with any other player on the field.
