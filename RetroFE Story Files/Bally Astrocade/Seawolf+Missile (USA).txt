 This cartridge consists of two games: Sea Wolf and Missile. Both can be played by one or two players.**Sea Wolf is a port of the arcade game with the same name.**Missile is based on the arcade game Guided Missile but differs in some ways. Like in the original game the aim is to shoot down targets (here only flying ones) with missiles but here the missiles do not descend back towards the ground after reaching the top. Instead the player here has to guide them on the way up. Another difference is that the player can move the missile base left and right before launching a missile.
