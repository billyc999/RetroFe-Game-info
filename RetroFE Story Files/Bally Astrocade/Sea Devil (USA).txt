You must destroy the hoard of poachers as quickly as possible because each bit of food (the white abalone on the bottom) they get will cost you bonus score at the end of the screen. Beware, the poachers are releasing under sea mines to destroy you, avoid them by evasive action. Each contact your craft makes will cost you 1 ship. Level 1 pits you against octopi & android divers. For each level that is cleared a new one will appear and the game speed will in-crease. Periodically Zardos will put additional kinds of his creatures in your path. This occurrs at level 2 with star fish added to the playfield, level 3 with jelly fish and level 5 with mechanical crabs. At level 7 Zardos' sub will appear and begin firing cluster bombs at you. Additional levels will provide increased speed and more attrac-tion between you and your opponents.
