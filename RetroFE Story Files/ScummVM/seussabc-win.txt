 Dr. Seuss’s ABC is a Living Book adaptation based on Dr. Seuss’s original picture book. In this book, children learn all about the alphabet while uncovering a few surprises along the way. Every word can be clicked to hear the pronunciation. This gives them a head start into learning new words. The recommended age group is 3 to 7. There is also an alphabet song included in the game.
