 A dastardly alien is stealing all of the children's Halloween candy! Tony Tough P.I. will not stand for this. He sets out to stop the fiend before it's to late, and the alien takes over the world! Tony Tough is a traditional 2D "point and click" adventure with a crazy story. The humor and style are reminiscent of old LucasArts games, like Day of the Tentacle.
