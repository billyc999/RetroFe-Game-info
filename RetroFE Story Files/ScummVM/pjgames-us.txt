 This collection of games is based off of the Junior Adventure character Pajama Sam - specifically, his game "You Are What You Eat From Your Head To Your Feet". As that game was based on food, so many of these familiar games have a food slant to them. And many of the characters found it the adventure game are found in these games too.  There are 10 games in this package, with 3 difficulty levels and three modes (1 player vs computer, 2 players and Demo - where the computer plays against itself). Games include Goody Goody Gumdrops (reversi), Jumping Beans (checkers), Fans and Teleporters (chutesandladders), Rockpile (oware), Happy Fun Square ( linesand boxes), Jigsaw Jumble (jigsaw puzzles), Super Slider (sliding tiles), Concentrate (concentration), Cheese and Crackers ( tic-tac-toe) and 4 Cheese Pizza (a "board" game).
