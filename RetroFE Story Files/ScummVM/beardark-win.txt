 The story opens in the library, where Sister Bear impatiently waits for Brother to check out a book. He finds one titled The Case of the Crying Cave, and Sister remarks that it sounds scary, and by contrast, borrows a much more cutesy book. Once they get home, both start to read their books, but Sister gets a little bored with hers, and begins reading with Brother. Brother begins to dramatize the book, and makes a howling noise that freaks out Sister. When they go to bed that night, Sister begins to picture dark things as spooky, and has trouble sleeping. Brother then makes a wailing noise, which causes her to cry for help. Mama and Papa rush into the kids' bedroom, tripping over each other, and Sister falls on top of them. Mama and Papa try to convince her that there's nothing to be afraid of, but it doesn't do any good at all, and both siblings fight whether to sleep with the lights on or off. The next morning, the Bear family is too tired to do anything. This finally leads to Papa explaining that her imagination has been taking control of her and making the dark look spooky. He takes her upstairs to the attic, and she tries not to let her imagination take her over. She soon begins to learn that she was only fooling herself and there was really nothing to be afraid of. Papa proceeds to show her his old night light, telling her that even he was afraid of the dark once, which puts Sister in disbelief. She goes back downstairs and decides to finish reading the rest of The Case of the Crying Cave. She gets disappointed when the wailing noise heard in the book turned out to just be wind, and remarks about this to Brother that night. The story has ended with Brother feeling a little uneasy about the darkness, and deciding that maybe he's had quite enough mysteries for a while.
