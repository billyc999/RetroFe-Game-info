 The Journeyman Project: Pegasus Prime is a remake of the earlier The Journeyman Project. The game's graphics and sound have been updated, the game has been modified to be more like the second game in the series Buried in Time and the third game (not released yet then) Legacy of Time. The story is the same as "The Journeyman Project (Turbo!)" and for the first time in the original story Agent 5 is called "Gage Blackwood".
