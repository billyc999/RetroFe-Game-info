 Arthur is excited about a brand new computer game called "Deep Dark Sea." Specifically, the goal of the game is to find "the thing," which if done, he'll win the prizes. Eager to do this, he spends all the time he can, but doesn't actually make it before bed-time. The next morning, Arthur invites Buster over, but can't use the computer since Mrs. Read is working on it. She tells them to stay off of it after taking a trip to her office, but they're both too anxious and choose to play the game anyway. They come across a treasure chest, and find out it's the "thing" they were looking for. They jump for the computer fighting over the mouse, and accidentally knock the keyboard off the desk, and the screen goes blank. Since turning the computer off and on again didn't solve the problem, they run through the manuals looking for a solution, and then decide to look for the Brain thinking he will know the solution. After searching for a long time, they finally see him at the pond, but he turns out to be no help either. As a last resort they go to the computer store asking for a solution. He explains his problem to the computer expert but the computer expert says that the fees for fixing are too high. Arthur then says that it would be more birthday money than he ever would see in his whole life. Mrs. Read comes home before they can fix it as a result, and Arthur is too nervous to talk to her. He desperately tries to keep her away from the computer, but Arthur is eventually forced to admit his mistake. Arthur asks if he is going to get punished and Mrs. Reed says "Of course. You did something you weren't supposed to do". D.W. tells Mrs. Reed to make the punishment "really good". Mrs. Read tells him he's being grounded from the computer for one whole week, but instead of getting back to her work, she decides to try the game out. When Arthur and D.W. are already for bed, she decided to play Arthur's Game: Deep Dark Sea.
