This is one of the less well known cartridge games, at least in the UK. The plot is certainly not original – it's the usual "aliens have taken over the Earth" story. You've got the latest helicopter and have to destroy the aliens. The game is a standard vertically scrolling shoot-'em-up where you fly your helicopter left and right, shoot 'planes and aliens, and collect some power-ups. The extra facilities of the Plus are used here to produce some nice graphics, but it's a shame that the game itself is rather dull.
