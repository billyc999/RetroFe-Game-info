A three-pack of classic board games. CANDY LAND - Come along with us down that Rainbow Road you know so well... from the Gingerbread Tree through the Peppermint Forest, into the Gumdrop Pass, across the Chocolate Swamp and into the Candy Castle... it's Candy Land like you’ve never seen it before! CHUTES AND LADDERS - Be the first to reach the top! Children learn counting and number recognition as they travel along the gameboard to get to the top. Land on a good deed space, and a ladder will race you ahead. But watch out for the chutes that can send you back down! MEMORY - Can you remember what's hiding where? It’s fun to find matching pictures of your favorite things, two by two. Just flip over cards, two at a time, trying to make a match. If you find the same two cards, you keep them! Find the most pairs and you’re the winner!
